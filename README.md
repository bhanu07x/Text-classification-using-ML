This project demonstrates how to build a Sentiment Analysis model to classify customer reviews as positive or negative.
The project starts with a Bag of Words (BoW) approach and then moves to Word2Vec to generate more meaningful word embeddings for improved performance.
The pipeline covers data cleaning, text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training using the Naive Bayes classifier.
